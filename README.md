# OOP & Polymorphism

This project tests various approaches to encapsulation and polymorphism using abstract classes and inheritance.

- Encapsulation: This is about bundling data with the methods that operate on that data, providing a way to restrict direct access to some of an object's components.

- Polymorphism: Literally means 'many forms'. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. 

- Abstract Classes: These are classes you can't instantiate directly; they're meant to be inherited from. They can contain abstract methods (methods without a body) that must be implemented by any concrete (non-abstract) subclass.

- Inheritance: This is when a class (child or subclass) inherits methods, properties, and behaviors from another class (parent or superclass). It promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.
